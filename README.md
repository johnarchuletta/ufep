# Udacity Project: Neighborhood Map App

Basic app requirements:

 - **Google Maps JavaScript API integration**:  App displays a Google Map with at least five location markers that the user can filter using arbitrary search criteria provided either by text input, drop downs, or radio buttons.
 - **KnockoutJS integration**: App should use Knockout for all UI state management.
 - **Third Party API integration**: The project should also integrate a separate third-party API besides Google Maps that retrieves data related to the locations displayed on the map.
 - **Asynchronous data handling**:  App should handle failed asynchronous requests gracefully.
 - **Proper usage of web technologies**: Student should follow all standards and guidelines when writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
